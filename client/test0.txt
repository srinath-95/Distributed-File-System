tring is a sequence of characters that is treated as a single data item and terminated by null character '\0'. 
Remember that C language does not support strings as a data type. A string is actually one-dimensional array of characters in C language. 
These are often used to create meaningful and readable programs.

For example: The string "hello world" contains 12 characters including '\0' character which is automatically added by the compiler at the end of the string.
In this assignment one distributed filesystem client (DFC) uploads and downloads to and
from 4 distributed file servers (DFS1, DFS2, DFS3 and DFS4). DFS stands for distributed
filesystem. The DFS servers are all running locally on a single machine with different
port numbers, for e.g. from 10001 to 10004.
When a DFC wants to upload a file to the 4 DFS servers, it first split the file in to 4 equal
length pieces P1, P2, P3, P4 (a small length difference is acceptable if the total length
cannot be divided by 4). Then the DFC groups the 4 pieces in to 4 pairs such as (P1, P2),
(P2, P3), (P3, P4), (P4, P1). Finally, the DFC uploads them onto 4 DFS servers. So now the
file has redundancy, 1 failed server will not affect the integrity of the file.
